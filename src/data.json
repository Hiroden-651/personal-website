            "text": "My journey into Computer Science began in early 2014 when a friend encouraged me to try programming. I immediately fell in love with the problem solving aspect of writing programs and decided to pursue a formal education. My time at university exposed me to Machine Learning, a topic which fascinated me and became a focus outside of my main studies. After graduating I began exploring the topic of Computer Security, which led me to learn things such as basic networking and ethical hacking. Currently I am looking to pursue a career as a software engineer while working on personal projects related to machine learning and cybersecurity."
